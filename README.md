# RBF
Radial Basis Function Network


We need to construct an interpolator using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with seed functions the Gaussian mappings where the standard deviations are all equal to σi. The original function is given by F(x)=root(|x|)*sin((pi/2)*x)

a: Build a radial basis function network and find the interpolation function 𝑓̂(𝑥) in the interval [-6 6] using training data at the points x=-6, x=-5, x=-2, x=0, x=1, x=3, x=5 with σ i=1. Draw the curves comparing the two functions (the original one and the interpolated). What is the value of the estimated interpolator at x=3.6?

b: Redo the same for σ i= 0.5, 3, 6.
